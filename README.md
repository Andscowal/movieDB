# movieDB

I don't get too many opportunities to work in React, but when I do, I like to build fun little applications 
to make sure I keep my API calling skills nice and sharp! Here's a simple app that utilizes the MovieDB API
and allows you to search for movies! 

This app is hosted on Heroku at https://powerful-bayou-93324.herokuapp.com/

Thanks for stopping by and happy coding!
